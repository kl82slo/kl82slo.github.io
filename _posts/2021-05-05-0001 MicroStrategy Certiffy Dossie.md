## Why do it?
Certified items have typically been reviewed by trusted members of your organization and are considered official sources of content, based on reliable data.
You can Certify Dossier on [Web](https://www2.microstrategy.com/producthelp/Current/ProjectDesignGuide/WebHelp/Lang_1033/Content/MicroStrategy_Web_and_Web_Universal.htm) or on [Workstation](https://www2.microstrategy.com/producthelp/Current/Workstation/WebHelp/Lang_1033/Content/home_workstation.htm).

## MicroStrategy Web
1. In MicroStrategy Web, right-click on a dossier and select Properties. <br />
